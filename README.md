Sample Sequelize Migration

The purpose of this repo is for dumping sequelize migration files that I made by my own

Installation
1. run: npm install
2. run: sequelize init
3. run: cp config/config.example.json config/config.json
4. modify config/config.json based on needs
5. run: sequelize db:migrate
6. done

Maybe there will be added Mocha and Chai as well in the future

As per 13 May 2024, there are 3 migrations tested
